# Getting Started with R and RStudio

This tutorial shows how to get started with R and it specifically focuses on R for analyzing language data but it offers valuable information for anyone who wants to get started with R. As such, this tutorial is aimed at fresh users or beginners with the aim of showcasing how to set up a R session in RStudio, how to set up R projects, and how to do basic operations using R. The aim is not to provide a fully-fledged from beginner-to-expert, all-you-need-to-know tutorial but rather to show how to properly and tidily set up a project before you start coding and exemplify common operations such as loading and manipulation tabular data and generating basic visualization using R.
