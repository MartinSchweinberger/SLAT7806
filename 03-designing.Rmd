# Designing a research project 

Welcome to Week 3 of SLAT7806, where we delve into the intricacies of designing a research project.

As we embark on this lecture, it's crucial to revisit the research process, emphasizing that planning and designing constitute the pivotal second step. This phase necessitates meticulous consideration of the research methodology vis-à-vis your research question and the acquisition of ethical clearance, a cornerstone of ethical research conduct.

Now, let's dissect the initial steps in planning and designing a research project. Your project design hinges on several key factors, starting with your research question. Reaffirming the study's purpose and delineating the investigation's focus lay the groundwork for determining the appropriate research methodology.

For instance, envision a scenario where your aim is to scrutinize disparities between native English speakers and English learners. Here, it's imperative to analyze both cohorts comprehensively rather than exclusively focusing on one. Additionally, consulting existing literature unveils valuable insights into methodological approaches adopted by previous researchers grappling with similar inquiries.

Continuing with our example of investigating disparities, examining prior studies reveals crucial factors researchers have scrutinized, such as the duration of instruction. Moreover, scrutinizing the methodologies employed in past research endeavors unveils a spectrum of investigative tools—from interviews to experiments to corpus data analysis—each offering unique perspectives on the research question.

Furthermore, while conceptualizing your research project, it's paramount to assess the available resources. Considerations such as project timelines, funding availability, access to requisite equipment, and your existing skill set or potential training needs significantly influence project feasibility and execution.

By meticulously aligning your research question with the appropriate methodology, drawing insights from prior research endeavors, and pragmatically evaluating available resources, you lay the groundwork for a robust and methodologically sound research project.

Let's delve into the realm of different study design types, which offer diverse methodologies to explore various research questions.

Study design types encompass a vast array of approaches, often classified into broader categories for conceptual clarity. Two prominent categories are cross-sectional and longitudinal design studies. In a cross-sectional study, researchers assess a large cohort of participants at a single time point. For instance, imagine measuring the vocabulary size of 200 five-year-old English-speaking children in one session—this exemplifies a cross-sectional study, as there's no follow-up with the participants. Conversely, longitudinal studies involve tracking a smaller group of participants over an extended period. For instance, in a longitudinal study on vocabulary size, researchers might repeatedly assess 20 English-speaking children from age 1 to age 10, administering tests annually. Interestingly, despite the difference in participant numbers, both study types yield 200 observations. While both study designs facilitate the examination of developmental trajectories, the choice between them hinges on various factors. Longitudinal studies, although offering insights into individual change over time, often entail lengthy durations and potential participant attrition, prompting consideration of cross-sectional designs. However, cross-sectional designs may limit the depth of understanding regarding individual development.

Another significant dichotomy in study designs lies in qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, each with distinct advantages and drawbacks. Qualitative research excels in contextualizing phenomena, providing nuanced insights into social dynamics. It fosters flexibility in data collection, enabling emergent themes to surface during research. However, qualitative studies may pose challenges in replication due to their exploratory nature and difficulty in generalizing findings across diverse settings. Furthermore, subjectivity inherent in qualitative research, as researchers immerse themselves in the research context, can raise concerns regarding data interpretation and the relative significance of observed factors. Despite these limitations, qualitative research remains indispensable for understanding complex social phenomena in rich detail.
Quantitative studies indeed offer a high degree of objectivity and replicability, making it possible for researchers to replicate experiments with consistent outcomes. This replicability enhances the credibility and reliability of research findings. Moreover, quantitative research allows for generalization, enabling researchers to extend their findings beyond the specific study population to broader contexts. By quantifying relationships between variables, researchers can discern the strength of each factor's impact on outcomes, providing valuable insights into causal relationships.

However, quantitative research also presents certain drawbacks. Its narrow focus on predetermined factors may overlook potentially relevant variables and insights, limiting the depth of understanding. Additionally, proficiency in statistical analysis is often required to effectively analyze quantitative data, which can pose a challenge for researchers without adequate training. Moreover, the controlled settings typical of quantitative experiments may create artificial conditions, raising concerns about the ecological validity of findings and their applicability to real-world scenarios.

Conversely, qualitative approaches offer rich, context-sensitive insights into complex phenomena. However, they may lack the objectivity and replicability of quantitative methods. Qualitative research often involves in-depth exploration of social dynamics, allowing researchers to uncover nuanced patterns and meanings within human behavior. Yet, the subjective nature of qualitative inquiry and the potential for researcher bias necessitate careful consideration during data interpretation.

Acknowledging the strengths and limitations of both approaches, researchers often adopt a mixed-methods approach to research design. By integrating qualitative and quantitative methodologies, researchers can capitalize on the respective strengths of each approach, providing a comprehensive understanding of the research topic.

When embarking on research design, it is essential to carefully consider the components of the study, such as participants, materials, and procedures. The selection of participants, for instance, requires attention to demographic diversity and homogeneity to ensure the representativeness of the study sample. For example, in investigating L2 Japanese acquisition in Australian universities, researchers may recruit a diverse group of adults representing various ages, genders, and backgrounds, all enrolled in Japanese language courses at Australian universities. This diverse yet homogeneous sample enhances the generalizability of findings while capturing the complexity of language learning experiences within a specific context.
Ensuring the appropriate composition of participants in your study is paramount to its validity and reliability. When selecting participants, it's essential to strike a balance between diversity and homogeneity. All participants in your study must share a common trait, such as learning Japanese in an Australian university, to align with the specific research question. This commonality helps focus the study on a particular phenomenon. However, excessive diversity within the sample can complicate data analysis by confounding factors, making it challenging to discern meaningful patterns. In such cases, refining the sample by selecting specific demographic characteristics, such as age and gender, while maintaining consistency in background, can enhance the clarity of results.

Conversely, overly homogenous samples may limit the generalizability of findings. For instance, restricting the sample to young adult females studying Japanese in Australian universities may not accurately represent the broader population of Japanese learners, potentially undermining the external validity of the study. Achieving a balance between homogeneity and diversity ensures that findings are both internally valid and generalizable to the target population.

When comparing multiple groups, it's crucial to ensure equivalence in all aspects except for the independent variable under investigation. This ensures that any observed differences between groups can be attributed to the specific variable being studied. For example, when comparing English learners with different lengths of residence in Australia, controlling for factors such as English proficiency and demographic characteristics helps isolate the effect of residence duration on language acquisition.

Moreover, defining clear participation criteria for each group is essential to maintain consistency and rigor in participant selection. By delineating inclusion and exclusion criteria, researchers can ensure that the sample accurately reflects the target population while minimizing confounding variables.

Transitioning to the realm of research methodology, the selection and description of materials used in the study are equally critical. Materials encompass a wide array of stimuli employed to elicit responses from participants, ranging from written prompts to audiovisual presentations. Providing detailed descriptions and examples of these materials enhances transparency and reproducibility, enabling other researchers to replicate the study effectively. Additionally, clear documentation of materials ensures consistency in data collection and analysis, thereby strengthening the reliability of research findings.

In many cases, researchers append a detailed list of materials to their papers, allowing readers to grasp the scope and sequence of the stimuli presented to participants. This transparency aids in methodological alignment and fosters consistency across studies. Moreover, the procedure acts as the glue that binds participants and materials together, delineating how individuals engage with the provided stimuli. It elucidates the tasks participants are expected to perform and sheds light on the overarching objectives of these tasks.

For instance, consider a study where participants are tasked with listening to a series of sentences and identifying grammatical errors by pressing a button. Here, the procedure elucidates the purpose behind this task—perhaps to assess error detection accuracy and speed in second language speech perception. Furthermore, the description of how the task is orchestrated, whether individually or in groups, in a controlled setting such as a quiet room, underscores the meticulous planning that underpins methodological rigor.

While the participants-materials-procedure trifecta forms the cornerstone of research design methodology, it's imperative to acknowledge the variations that exist within this structure. For instance, studies examining textual representations of cultural nuances in language textbooks may forego participant involvement, focusing instead on rigorous content analysis or text mining techniques. This divergence highlights the versatility of research methodology and underscores the need for adaptability in study design.

At its essence, the alignment between research questions and selected methods serves as the linchpin of methodological coherence. While research questions steer the selection of methodology, researchers have the latitude to explore diverse methods to address similar inquiries. This symbiotic relationship underscores the dynamism inherent in research methodology and underscores the importance of adopting an open-minded approach when navigating the labyrinth of scientific inquiry.

In this example, we embark on an exploration of the attention devoted to grammatical errors, a pivotal aspect in second language research. The investigation unfolds through various tasks or methodologies, each offering distinct insights into speech perception. One such task, as previously discussed, involves a conscious listening task where participants identify errors by pressing a button, thereby gauging accuracy and response speed.

However, delving deeper into the subconscious realm, electroencephalography (EEG) emerges as a formidable tool. By affixing an EEG cap embedded with sensors and electrodes to measure brain activity, researchers can uncover the subconscious reactions to error-laden speech stimuli. Participants are presented with sentences, some containing errors, without explicit instructions to focus on errors. The EEG records the brain's covert responses, unveiling distinct neural patterns in response to deviant versus standard speech stimuli, as depicted by the contrasting green and black dotted lines on the EEG graph.

In essence, diverse methodologies offer multifaceted avenues to probe the same research question. Conversely, a singular method can serve as a versatile lens to examine a spectrum of research inquiries. Consider interviews—an invaluable research procedure adaptable to various objectives. Interviews can capture participants' attitudes towards second language acquisition or delve into their spontaneous speech production, assessing fluency and error correction. They also facilitate investigations into accents and linguistic nuances. Attitude-oriented inquiries often lend themselves to qualitative analysis, whereas performance-based assessments are quantifiable, aligning with quantitative methods.

Amidst the methodological discourse, ethical considerations stand as a cornerstone. Researchers, often engaging with primary data directly from individuals, must navigate ethical complexities. Institutional ethics boards oversee potential risks, benefits, privacy, and confidentiality concerns, ensuring adherence to ethical guidelines. Universities typically house human research ethics committees charged with safeguarding participants' welfare and upholding ethical standards. Thus, ethical vigilance intertwines with methodological rigor, ensuring research endeavors prioritize ethical integrity alongside scholarly excellence.

Before commencing any study involving human participants, it's imperative to secure ethical clearance through an application process, typically involving interaction between the researcher and the human research ethics officer. This rigorous procedure ensures that research activities adhere to ethical guidelines, safeguarding the welfare and rights of participants.

At a community level, researchers must navigate cultural sensitivities and values, exercising caution to avoid topics that may evoke trauma or offense within specific cultural contexts. Respectful engagement with communities fosters trust and cooperation, essential for ethically sound research practices.

On an individual level, researchers bear the responsibility of transparently communicating participation guidelines to participants. Informed consent, obtained through a detailed consent form, elucidates the study's purpose, procedures, and data usage, empowering participants to make informed decisions. Participants must be assured of their right to withdraw from the study at any stage without repercussions.

Transitioning to the Methods section of a research paper, it adopts a structured format mirroring the delineated sections for participants, materials, and procedures. This detailed exposition ensures replicability and verifiability of the study's findings, a cornerstone of scientific rigor. While individual participant information remains confidential, presenting aggregate data or anonymizing individual identifiers upholds ethical standards.

In summary, the complexity of research methodologies necessitates careful consideration of participant selection criteria, meticulous description of materials, and clear articulation of procedural details. While research questions guide methodological choices, flexibility allows for innovative approaches tailored to specific inquiries. Upholding ethical standards, including transparent communication and respect for participants' autonomy, is paramount throughout the research process. Ethical considerations remain central to ethical research practices, ensuring integrity and trustworthiness in scholarly endeavors.
