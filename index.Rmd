## Basic Course Information {-}

### Course Description {-}

This is a postgraduate-level course on academic research methods in language and culture studies, with a particular focus on the areas of language use, learning, and teaching. The course covers a wide variety of issues and topics raised in current and seminal works on language acquisition across ages, in different communities, in and out of the classroom context. It is designed to familiarize the students with a range of qualitative and quantitative research techniques and ethical research practices. The students are also introduced to the core steps of conceptualizing, designing, undertaking, and presenting a research project, which are the essential skills for postgraduate students and academics.

## Aims, Objectives & Graduate Attributes {-}


### Course Aims {-}

 
The course aims to introduce research methodology in (applied) linguistics and second language studies. It will present the fundamental skills needed to plan and carry out various types of postgraduate research, ranging from structuring course papers and dissertation, to basic practical data collection and analysis tools and techniques. Topics examined include the nature and types of research, research quality and planning, honesty and ethics in research, library and database searches, developing a research topic and literature review, preparing a research proposal, and critical reading and writing skills. Course assessments will provide the opportunity to apply these skills in relevant research tasks.
 

### Learning Objectives {-}

After successfully completing this course you should be able to:

1.  Understand the nature and process of research and familiarize yourself with different research areas in language and culture studies
	
2.  Comprehend the basic aspects and components of research methodology, from the inception of a research project to data collection, analysis, and presentation
	
3.  Critically review, analyse, and synthesize findings from a range of secondary sources
	
4.  Design and present your research proposal in a manner conforming to accepted academic standards in both written and spoken form
	
5.  Identify, locate, and effectively use research materials relevant to your field of study
