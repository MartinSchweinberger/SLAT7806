# Preface {-}

## Basic Course Information {-}

### Course Description {-}

This is a postgraduate-level course on academic research methods in language and culture studies, with a particular focus on the areas of language use, learning, and teaching. The course covers a wide variety of issues and topics raised in current and seminal works on language acquisition across ages, in different communities, in and out of the classroom context. It is designed to familiarize the students with a range of qualitative and quantitative research techniques and ethical research practices. The students are also introduced to the core steps of conceptualizing, designing, undertaking, and presenting a research project, which are the essential skills for postgraduate students and academics.

## Aims, Objectives & Graduate Attributes {-}


### Course Aims {-}

 
The course will introduce the conceptual, analytical and technical tools students need to understand quantitative findings in the language research literature and to use quantitative methods in their own research. It will do this by meeting three aims. The course will provide:
 
1. grounding in the basic logic and scope of quantitative reasoning (= statistics) in language research  
2. exposure to commonly used statistical techniques   
3. in-depth experience in using R (RStudio)  
 

### Learning Objectives {-}

After successfully completing this course you should be able to:

1. 	Understand and apply basic statistical tests in applied linguistics and second language acquisition.  
2. 	Understand the role of quantitative evidence in describing and explaining language learning and use.  
3. 	Read quantitative research in these areas in a more critical and productive manner.  
4. 	Use statistical software to analyse and present data.  
5. 	Write up results for a dissertation or publication.
