# About the Course 

**Course Description** 

This course is an introduction to research methodology in language learning and teaching. It covers the skills needed to plan and carry out various types of postgraduate research, ranging from course papers to the dissertation.

This is a postgraduate-level course on academic research methods in language and culture studies, with a particular focus on the areas of language use, learning, and teaching. The course covers a wide variety of issues and topics raised in current and seminal works on language acquisition across ages, in different communities, in and out of the classroom context. It is designed to familiarize the students with a range of qualitative and quantitative research techniques and ethical research practices. The students are also introduced to the core steps of conceptualizing, designing, undertaking, and presenting a research project, which are the essential skills for postgraduate students and academics. 

**Course Changes in Response to Previous Student Feedback**

Weekly Online Tasks, which were restricted to the first half of the semester, have been extended to week 11 to give students the opportunity to show that they have understood the content of the lectures and the required readings. The marking of the Study Online Tasks is now completely automated, thus, streamlining the learning process  and providing immediate feedback. The oral presentations of the Research Proposals in weeks 12 and 13 have been dropped which allows students to spend more time on preparing their Research Proposals, which is a major research-based assessment at the end of the semester. To enable students to receive feedback and allowing them to learn how to give constructive feedback and receive feedback, students will evaluate drafts of Research proposal in the tutorials. In addition, dropping the oral presentations also takes away pressure at the end of the semester when many assessments are due and students often feel overwhelmed. The maximum time allotted for completion of each weekly task has not been increased from 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes because the Online Study Tasks do not require text responses anymore.

**Course Aims**


The course aims to introduce research methodology in (applied) linguistics and second language studies. It will present the fundamental skills needed to plan and carry out various types of postgraduate research, ranging from structuring course papers and dissertation, to basic practical data collection and analysis tools and techniques. Topics examined include the nature and types of research, research quality and planning, honesty and ethics in research, library and database searches, developing a research topic and literature review, preparing a research proposal, and critical reading and writing skills. Course assessments will provide the opportunity to apply these skills in relevant research tasks.

**Learning Objectives**

After successfully completing this course you should be able to:

1.  Understand the nature and process of research and familiarise yourself with different research areas in applied linguistics and the language sciences more widely.
	
2.  Comprehend the basic aspects and components of research methodology, from the inception of a research project including data collection, analysis, and presentation.
	
3.  Critically review, analyse, and synthesise findings from a range of secondary sources.
	
4.  Design, discuss, and present your research proposal in a manner conforming to accepted academic standards.
	
5.  Identify, locate, and effectively use research materials relevant to your field of study


**Flipped Classroom Design**

This is a flipped course with both online and face-to-face components.

* You are expected to have watched the lectures/listened to the lecture recordings as well as have read through the slides before you attend the tutorials. The slides and lectures are all available online on Blackboard both as videos and as podcasts. 

* The tutorials take place as face-to-face sessions, either online and on-site and they are recorded. Any materials you need for the tutorials, e.g. tutorial slides, activity handouts with exercises, videos, or any other materials are available online on Blackboard.


* In addition to the lectures and tutorials, you will need to read relevant chapters of books which are listed on Blackboard.

All resources above are essential for successful assessment completion!

**Use of AI in Assessments**

For the Study Online Tasks and the Academic Integrity Online Module:

> These assessment tasks evaluate students' abilities, skills and knowledge without the aid of Artificial Intelligence (Al). Students are advised that the use of Al technologies to develop responses is strictly prohibited and may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. 

For The Annotated Bibliography and the Research Proposal:

> Artificial Intelligence (Al) provides emerging tools that may support students in completing this assessment task. Students may appropriately use AI in completing this assessment task. Students must clearly reference any use of Al in each instance. 
A failure to reference Al use may constitute student misconduct under the Student Code of Conduct. 


**Course Grading**
	

Example criteria for each of the grades can be found in PPL 3.10.02 Assessment Procedures - section 7 Appendix.

* Grade X: No assessable work received.

* *Grade 1, Low Fail*: Absence of evidence of achievement of course learning outcomes: Weighted composite score of between 0-24%. No submitted work or submitted work incomplete. The minimum percentage required for a grade of 1 is 0%.

* *Grade 2, Fail*: Minimal evidence of achievement of course learning outcomes: Weighted composite score of between 25-44%. Student shows little understanding of the research process, manifested in consistent lack of application of research techniques to assessment items, inability to formulate a topic and central question, very limited degree of analysis and synthesis of findings from data, and lack of clear and logical presentation of findings in a manner consistent with accepted academic standards. Nil or very poor bibliographic and citation technique.

* *Grade 3, Marginal Fail*: Demonstrated evidence of developing achievement of course learning outcomes: Weighted composite score of between 45-49%. Falls short of satisfying all basic requirements of a pass. Student shows a poor understanding of the research process, manifested in lack of application of research techniques to most assessment items, poor ability to formulate a topic and central question, a limited degree of analysis and synthesis of findings from data, and substantial lapses in clear and logical presentation of findings in a manner consistent with accepted academic standards. Poor bibliographic and citation technique.

**Late Submission**
	

*Extensions*

In exceptional circumstances beyond a student’s control, which prevent them from submitting an assessment item by the due date and time, students can apply for an extension.

Extensions can be requested for assessment items such as:

* oral assessment for individuals or groups  
* essays  
* assignments  
* case studies  
* laboratory reports  
* take-home essays  
* tutorial group assignments  

Applications to request an extension of assessment due date must be submitted through my.UQ, on or before the assessment item’s due date and time. A request for an extension of the assessment due date must be accompanied by supporting documentation that is truthful, accurate, describes in detail why an extension is required, and demonstrates the impact of the circumstances on a student’s academic performance to justify the entire period they were affected.

Requests for extensions received after the assessment item submission due date and time must include evidence of the reasons for the late request.

In the case of a group assessment item, an extension approved for an individual does not apply to the whole group.

The following penalties apply to late or non-submission of an assessment item:   
* A penalty of 10% of the maximum possible mark allocated for the assessment item, or one grade per day if graded on the basis of 1-7, or equivalent penalty if a different grading approach is used, will be deducted for every day for up to 7 calendar days, at which point any submission will not receive any marks. Each 24 hour block is recorded from the time the submission is due; 

or 

* A penalty of 100% for a late assessment item may be set provided it is academically justified and communicated in the course profile.

*Deferred Exams*

Deferred examinations are available for the following assessment items, whether they are written, theory-based, practical, or online:

* Mid-semester deferred exam request – applies to exams held at any time other than during the University's end-of-semester exam block periods.  
* End-of-semester deferred exam request – applies only to exams held during the University's designated end-of-semester exam periods.

Students can apply for a deferred exam:
* if there are exceptional or unavoidable circumstances, or  
* as a one-off discretionary request.  

*Apply for a deferred exam*

Submit a ‘deferred examinations request’ through mySI-net. You can save this application and come back to it at any time.

For information on deferred exams and instructions on how to apply please see myUQ information on deferring an exam.

*Late applications*

Applications should be submitted no later than 5 calendar days after the date of the original exam. However, there may be circumstances that prevent you from submitting on time.

If more than 5 calendar days have passed since the date of the original examination, a Late Notice link will appear on the deferred exam request form in mySI-net. The Late Notice provides instructions about what you can do next.

*What to expect after you apply*

Your deferred examination request(s) must have a status of "submitted" in mySI-net to be assessed.

* All applications for deferred mid-semester examinations are assessed by the relevant school.  
* Applications for deferred end-of-semester examinations are assessed by the Academic Services Division.  

You’ll receive an email to your student email account when the status of your application is updated.

*Approved deferred exam applications*

* If your deferred mid-semester examination request is approved, the relevant school will notify you of the scheduled date and time of your deferred examination. Deferred mid-semester examinations are held during a period nominated by the relevant school.  
* If your end-of-semester deferred examination request is approved you will receive a timetable the Friday prior to the deferred exam period. You must be available during this time to take your exam.
