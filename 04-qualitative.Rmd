# Qualitative Research Methods

In today's SLAT7806 Research Methods lecture, we delve into the realm of **qualitative research**. Before we embark on this exploration, let's recap what we covered last week. We delved into the intricacies of selecting and formulating an appropriate methodology for our study.

Specifically, we discussed the intricacies of **participant recruitment**, the selection of **materials** ranging from word lists to visual stimuli, and the formulation of **tasks** and **procedures** to engage participants with these materials effectively.

Building on our previous discussion, today and in the forthcoming week, we expand our focus to encompass a broader spectrum of research methodology. We revisit the fundamental notion of a **research question**, explore the diverse array of **data types** prevalent in linguistic and applied linguistic research, delve into methods of data interpretation, and delve into the nuances of crafting a comprehensive final report. All of these facets are scrutinized through the lens of comparing qualitative and quantitative studies.

The centerpiece of today's lecture is qualitative research. We commence by providing a comprehensive **definition** and delineating its distinctive **features**. Subsequently, we navigate through the core **study types** within qualitative research, with particular emphasis on case studies and ethnography, while briefly touching upon other methodologies. We then pivot to an examination of qualitative **data collection procedures**, including observation, interviews, questionnaires, focus groups, diaries, and discourse analysis. Finally, we cap off our discussion by dissecting the **strengths** and **weaknesses** inherent in qualitative research methodologies.

Now, let's embark on our journey into the domain of qualitative research with an overarching **overview**. At its core, qualitative research encapsulates a diverse array of methodologies, all united by their focus on **meaning-making**. Rather than merely quantifying phenomena, qualitative research seeks to unravel the intricacies of the human experience by delving into the **whys** and **hows** behind observed phenomena. It endeavors to decipher the underlying **processes** and **contexts** that shape human behavior and interactions, aiming to make sense of the multifaceted world that surrounds us.


**Qualitative research** distinguishes itself by presenting data in **words** rather than numbers. When you peruse a qualitative research study, expect to encounter discussions brimming with **codes**, **labels**, **narratives**, and **vignettes**, instead of statistical metrics or test results. Numerical data is not typically featured in qualitative research outputs. Moreover, qualitative research employs **interpretive means** to analyze data, deeply intertwined with its emphasis on **meaning-making**.

At its essence, qualitative research strives to illuminate specific issues or problems by interpreting collected data. This methodology finds application across a diverse array of academic disciplines. Traditionally rooted in the social sciences, such as anthropology and philosophy, qualitative research has recently made inroads into various applied fields and disciplines, including psychology, education, linguistics, applied linguistics, policy analysis, business studies, law, medical research, and environmental research.

The foundational assumptions of qualitative research about our world posit that **reality** is **multifaceted**, **complex**, and **socially constructed**, implying its inherent subjectivity and the necessity of holistic exploration. This perspective underscores the belief that variables or phenomena under investigation are intricately **interconnected** and **difficult to isolate** for study.

Consider, for example, an investigation into the **maintenance of heritage languages** in **multilingual communities**, such as various immigrant communities in Australia, where English serves as the dominant language in wider society. Within these communities, individuals may speak one or more **heritage languages** at home, prompting inquiry into the strategies employed to preserve these languages within family and community contexts. This scenario underscores the intricate interplay of language, culture, and identity within diverse sociolinguistic landscapes.

In exploring questions regarding heritage language maintenance within immigrant communities in Australia, a multifaceted approach is imperative, considering various factors that shape language preservation. Among these factors, **perceived linguistic prestige** of the heritage language in comparison to the dominant societal language holds significance. Different languages carry diverse levels of perceived prestige; for instance, certain European languages enjoy high prestige, potentially making their maintenance more feasible than languages with lower social standing.

Moreover, **language policies** and **educational strategies** implemented in Australian schools within these communities play pivotal roles. The availability of services and media in the heritage language further impacts language retention, enhancing accessibility and fostering proficiency among speakers.

Socio-linguistic and socio-cultural affiliations also influence language maintenance decisions. Individuals may grapple with the balance between assimilating into the wider society and preserving their cultural identity. Exploring these dynamics often involves analyzing **code-switching** patterns, observing whether English infiltrates utterances in the heritage language. Generational factors and identity issues within individuals add layers of complexity to the inquiry.

Qualitative research views these factors as interconnected rather than existing independently, making it challenging to isolate singular influences on the target question. The exploratory nature of qualitative research facilitates the discovery of new ideas and insights, offering a deeper understanding of observed phenomena.

Consider the research question: **How do immigrant communities in Australia maintain their heritage language?** While this question provides a starting point, qualitative research often begins with a broader **research purpose** or **inquiry**, allowing flexibility for the research question to evolve organically. This iterative process may lead to refining the focus on specific aspects, such as generational differences in language maintenance or variations across cultural groups.

Qualitative research is inherently **nonlinear**, with the research question subject to revision and refinement as the project progresses and new insights emerge. For example, the initial inquiry may pivot to examine the influence of social media on language maintenance, highlighting the dynamic and adaptive nature of qualitative research methodologies. Adaptability to the evolving context of the study ensures that research inquiries remain relevant and responsive to emerging trends and phenomena.
Qualitative research is often characterized as **inductive**, meaning it begins with specific observations that are context-dependent and idiosyncratic. From these observations, researchers aim to discern patterns of behavior. In the realm of linguistics and applied linguistics, these patterns can lead to the formulation of a **working hypothesis**, which offers a broader and more generalized understanding than the initial observations. Subsequently, researchers test this hypothesis to develop a theory applicable to a wider population.

However, it's essential to recognize that qualitative research does not seek to be predictive or generalizable. While some studies may progress to propose theories based on initial observations and hypothesis testing, the primary aim is to explore a specific scenario in depth. This scenario may vary significantly from others, making generalizability challenging.

Moving on to the features of qualitative research, it is centered on **participants' interactions** and **experiences** regarding specific phenomena. Emphasizing the subjectivity inherent in qualitative research, these interactions, experiences, and viewpoints are ideally studied in natural settings such as communities, language classrooms, homes, workplaces, and online platforms. Researchers minimize intervention, aiming to observe participants' behavior in authentic contexts.

Illustrating these features, consider the words of qualitative researchers who stress the importance of immersing oneself in the participants' worlds. William Labov, a prominent figure in sociolinguistics, highlights the aim of linguistic research to capture natural speech patterns. However, he acknowledges the challenge posed by the **observer paradox**, where participants may modify their behavior due to being aware of observation. Overcoming this paradox requires thoughtful methodological considerations to ensure the authenticity of data collection.

Reflecting on these quotes prompts consideration of whether qualitative research aligns more with fieldwork or desk-based approaches. Additionally, addressing the observer paradox necessitates strategies to minimize the impact of observation on participants' natural behaviors. These discussions underscore the nuanced nature of qualitative research methodology and its ongoing evolution in addressing research challenges.

To conclude the discussion on the features of qualitative research, it's crucial to emphasize that its **purpose** is to interpret, contextualize, and understand various participants' perspectives on the phenomenon under investigation. Unlike quantitative research, which often seeks to summarize data, qualitative research treats each perspective as an individual viewpoint, aiming for an **in-depth comprehension** of each one. Data in qualitative research is typically analyzed by identifying **themes** and **categories**, with research reports featuring numerous quotes from participants to illustrate the researcher's points and arguments. Consequently, the write-up of a qualitative research paper or thesis tends to be descriptive in nature, providing rich detail and context to support the findings.

Now that we are acquainted with the nature and core features of qualitative research, let's delve into some of its study **types**, starting with case studies. In case studies, the scope of investigation is dictated by the researcher's interest, often referred to as **bounded systems**. Depending on the breadth of interest, three types of case studies can be identified.

The first type is an **intrinsic case study**, which focuses on describing an individual case of a particular person. Here, the goal is to provide a detailed and in-depth description of their behavior, experiences, or opinions on a specific phenomenon. For instance, in exploring heritage language maintenance, we might investigate how an individual is maintaining their heritage language without seeking to extrapolate findings to external cases.

The second type is an **instrumental case study**, which also involves a narrow focus on exploring a particular issue. However, unlike the intrinsic case, instrumental case studies entail some interpretation in addition to description. For example, we might ask how heritage language maintenance can be better supported based on an individual's account. This type of case study allows researchers to draw practical insights or recommendations based on their findings.

Finally, there are **collective or multiple case studies**, where the focus is on describing and evaluating multiple cases in light of a particular issue. Here, we examine group dynamics in relation to a specific topic, allowing for broader insights into patterns or trends across multiple cases. Typically, the individuals participating in a case study are interconnected in some way, such as belonging to the same location, school, or having pre-existing relationships. This type of case study enables researchers to explore variations and commonalities among different cases, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon under investigation.

The definition of a **case** varies depending on the area of research interest. In fields like second language acquisition, linguistics, applied linguistics, and psycholinguistics, a case study usually centers on a single individual or a small group. In contrast, in Political Studies, a case may represent a larger entity such as a state or country. Understanding the concept of a case is essential for effectively designing and conducting qualitative research across diverse disciplines. By selecting the appropriate case study type and defining the scope of investigation, researchers can tailor their approach to best address their research questions and objectives, ultimately contributing to the advancement of knowledge in their respective fields.

Ethnographic studies represent another significant category within qualitative research, particularly in the fields of Applied Linguistics and Linguistics. Their primary objective is to **describe** people's behavior in naturally occurring, ongoing settings through **prolonged observation**. By this definition, it becomes evident that ethnographic studies are inherently **longitudinal**, requiring sustained engagement with the subject group, and the observed behavior must be **interpreted through a cultural lens**.

A key distinction between ethnography and case studies lies in their approach to cultural interpretation. While both may investigate behavior in natural settings, ethnography places a stronger emphasis on **cultural background**. Unlike case studies, which may focus solely on behavior, ethnography seeks to understand the **cultural context** shaping that behavior.

Given that culture is collective rather than individual, ethnography tends to concentrate on **group dynamics** rather than individual actions. This includes examining **traditions**, **customs**, **linguistic behavior**, **group membership**, and **gatekeeping** mechanisms. Ethnographic research explores how groups distinguish insiders from outsiders and the measures they take to maintain these distinctions.

Historically, ethnographic research was associated with studying less-known cultures. However, researchers have since realized that the **cultural lens** can be applied to various communities, leading to a broader scope of ethnographic inquiry. Groups studied may share geographical location, industry, online platforms, or generational identity, offering diverse perspectives on cultural dynamics.

The outcome of an ethnographic study is a **comprehensive cultural portrait** of the group under investigation, including their linguistic behavior in the context of Linguistics and Applied Linguistics research. For instance, an ethnographic study might examine the **cultural influences** on heritage language maintenance within Lebanese Arabic immigrant communities in Australia, providing insights into how cultural factors shape language practices.

It's important to emphasize that the cultural angle distinguishes ethnography from other qualitative approaches, such as case studies. While case studies may explore behavior in natural settings, they may not always delve deeply into cultural interpretations.

While case studies and ethnography are foundational qualitative methodologies, qualitative research encompasses a broader range of study types. For instance, **action research** is another significant approach, which we will explore in more detail in subsequent lectures.

Action research is a **self-reflective** process and approach aimed at investigating one's professional practices with the goal of achieving **practical outcomes** to improve professional goals or careers. Its versatility extends across various fields, including **language learning and teaching**, **interpreting and translation**, and even **research practices** themselves can benefit from action research methodologies.

**Narrative inquiry**, on the other hand, involves analyzing a person's life through the collection of stories about their experiences. This approach has found extensive use in **second language studies**, where individuals' lives, particularly those of immigrants, are intimately intertwined with their language acquisition journey. The narratives of their lives often reflect their progress as learners of a second language, offering valuable insights into their linguistic development.

Another significant qualitative research approach is **phenomenology**, which focuses on gathering **subjective experiences**, **opinions**, and **meanings** from multiple individuals regarding a single phenomenon. By embracing the diversity of opinions, phenomenology aims to construct a more comprehensive understanding of a particular issue or problem, enriching the **worldview** surrounding it.

Moving on to qualitative data collection procedures, **observation** stands out as a common method where researchers notice and record participants' natural behaviors in their everyday environments. Observations can be classified into structured and casual or unstructured categories. In structured observations, researchers follow a predetermined checklist of behaviors, streamlining data coding and processing. However, this method may overlook other interesting behaviors that are not included in the checklist.

Conversely, casual observation involves no preset checklist, allowing researchers to notice and observe any relevant patterns that emerge, potentially leading to richer data. While data processing in casual observation may be more time-consuming due to the abundance of data, it often uncovers interesting patterns that can inform the research question or broader inquiry.

Observational research also varies based on the role of the researcher, distinguishing between the **complete observer** and the **participant observer**. While the complete observer remains detached from the observed context, the participant observer actively engages with the environment, potentially influencing the observed behaviors. Each role offers unique insights into the research subject, contributing to the depth and richness of qualitative inquiry.

A **complete observer** is a researcher who remains unknown to the participant group being observed, ensuring the most **natural behavior** from participants. However, this approach raises **ethical concerns** since individuals may feel uncomfortable being observed without their knowledge. On the other hand, a **participant observer** is a researcher who becomes part of the community being studied, engaging in their daily lives. While this method is more **ethically sound**, it challenges the **objectivity** of the observer, as their involvement in the community may influence their interpretation of the data.

Moving on to qualitative data collection procedures, **interviews** are a common method, categorized based on their structure. **Unstructured interviews** allow for open-ended discussions, encouraging participants to express themselves freely. Conversely, **semi-structured interviews** provide a loose framework to guide the conversation while allowing for flexibility in exploring diverse topics.

Asking **open-ended questions** during interviews is particularly useful in qualitative research, as it encourages participants to provide detailed responses, offering valuable insights into their perspectives and experiences. While we touched upon observations, interviews, and questioning techniques in last week's tutorial, this week's session will delve deeper into these procedures, including practical observation exercises and discussions on effective interview and questionnaire design.

**Focus groups** occupy a unique position between interviews and questionnaires. They involve multiple individuals from diverse backgrounds coming together to discuss a specific topic or issue. By harnessing the **group dynamic**, focus groups offer the advantages of multiple perspectives while fostering **interactive discussions** among participants.

Conducting a **focus group** can often be more efficient than conducting individual interviews in terms of time. Additionally, focus groups are perceived as less intimidating than one-on-one interviews, similar to questionnaires, because participants in a focus group do not always directly address the researcher. This setup can encourage more open and spontaneous discussions among participants.

**Diaries** are another valuable method of data collection, providing firsthand accounts and introspective reflections from participants. They offer a wealth of data and insights, but researchers must consider the **subjectivity** inherent in diary entries, as they represent the individual's personal perspective and experiences.

**Discourse analysis** is a widely used procedure in qualitative research, involving the examination of language use in both spoken and written communication. This method offers insights into how language constructs meaning and shapes social interactions, a topic we will explore further in a separate session.

Before embarking on a research project, researchers must carefully evaluate whether qualitative research aligns with their objectives. Understanding the **strengths and weaknesses** of qualitative approaches is crucial for making informed decisions.

One key advantage of qualitative research is its ability to provide **rich and in-depth descriptions** of phenomena, capturing the complexity and interconnectedness of various factors. This detailed understanding can inform future research endeavors and contribute to the development of comprehensive conceptual frameworks.

Moreover, qualitative research serves as an essential step in the research process, particularly in exploratory studies aimed at generating hypotheses or theories. By exploring issues in depth, qualitative research lays the groundwork for formulating specific research questions and predictions in subsequent studies.

Another strength of qualitative research lies in its ability to offer **vivid and meaningful insights** into issues, often through concrete examples. These examples can make research findings more accessible and compelling to diverse audiences, including policymakers, educators, and practitioners in fields such as bilingual education, language teaching, and translation. Vivid examples are often preferred as they can engage audiences more effectively than dry numerical data, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the research findings.

When discussing the weaknesses of qualitative research, it's important to recognize that **data collection and processing** in qualitative studies can be exceedingly laborious and time-consuming. Procedures such as prolonged observations and the intricate coding of data require significant investments of researchers' time and effort.

For example, following an interview, researchers must meticulously transcribe recorded data to identify patterns and code specific utterances made by participants. Moreover, **subjectivity** in qualitative research poses a challenge, stemming from various sources. Researcher bias, especially prevalent when researchers are not merely passive observers, can influence interpretations of data.

However, employing **triangulation** can mitigate this bias by utilizing multiple data collection methods, serving as a safeguard against researcher bias. Participant bias is another concern, as data obtained from interviews or diaries inherently reflects the subjective viewpoints of participants.

Additionally, **generalizability** of findings is often questioned in qualitative research due to the idiosyncratic nature of investigations. Each case may offer unique insights but may not be universally applicable or informative of broader phenomena.

Furthermore, the **credibility and quality of conclusions** in qualitative research may be scrutinized, as interpretations are subjective and influenced by researchers' theoretical frameworks and personal experiences.

To address these weaknesses, researchers are encouraged to integrate **both qualitative and quantitative techniques** through mixed methods studies. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding by combining subjective and objective perspectives on a given problem.

In conclusion, qualitative research aims to capture and interpret the complexity of the real world through individual or group perspectives, presenting descriptions through words rather than numbers. While qualitative research offers rich and detailed data, its contextualized nature can hinder quick analysis and generalizability. By embracing both qualitative and quantitative methods, researchers can achieve a more nuanced and robust understanding of complex phenomena.
