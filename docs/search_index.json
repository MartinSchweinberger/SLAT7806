[["discourse-analysis-and-situated-language.html", "Week 14 Discourse Analysis and Situated Language", " Week 14 Discourse Analysis and Situated Language In today’s SLAT7806 Research Methods lecture, we delve into the exploration of discourse analysis and situated language use, which collectively constitute discourse. While discourse is often synonymous with language in use, or language and context, it’s important to recognize the nuanced differences between these terms, even though they are closely related. When we examine discourse, we’re essentially scrutinizing how language functions in various contexts, whether written or spoken. For the purpose of this lecture, we’ll treat terms like discourse, language in use, text, and talk as interchangeable. Now, let’s explore why investigating language use is a significant endeavor. Whether we’re crafting written compositions, delivering oral presentations, engaging in spontaneous conversations, or scripting pre-planned dialogues, language use serves as a window into our identities and environments. When we produce language, we wield it as a tool for both conscious and subconscious self-expression and identification. For instance, as I deliver this lecture, I consciously identify myself as a university lecturer, and my subconscious self-expression may manifest through nuances like my foreign accent. These aspects of language use not only reflect our personal identities but also reveal societal and cultural influences. From a perspective of language perception, language in use offers insights into individuals’ backgrounds, social and cultural norms, and linguistic conventions. It serves as a mirror reflecting accepted patterns and norms within a given society. Ultimately, examining language in use provides a rich understanding not only of linguistic structures but also of their intricate connections with broader cultural and societal contexts. Today, our focus revolves around the question of how we analyze language in use, and my objective is to provide you with an overview of various methods within the confines of this brief lecture. We’ll embark on a journey spanning different areas of linguistic inquiry, starting with sociolinguistics, which delves into the intricate relationship between language and society. From there, we’ll transition to bilingualism research, honing in specifically on the phenomenon of code-switching. Moving forward, we’ll explore the realm of literary texts through stylistics and then venture into discourse analysis. Finally, we’ll cap off our discussion with an overview of corpus linguistics. These five focal points encapsulate expansive domains of linguistic and applied linguistic investigation, each rich with its own complexities and intricacies. Given the breadth of these topics, our exploration today merely scratches the surface of what could be studied within each framework. However, I hope to ignite your curiosity and inspire further exploration into these linguistic realms. Let’s delve into bilingualism, an area of research that has garnered considerable attention in recent years. Bilingualism can be approached from various angles, including investigations into its cognitive benefits and its implications for education and policy-making. In today’s context, as we examine language in use, we’ll zoom in on a characteristic behavior commonly observed among bilingual individuals: code-switching. So, what exactly is code-switching? Broadly defined, it involves the mixing of two or more languages within discourse, extending beyond the confines of a single sentence. Essentially, individuals proficient in multiple languages or language varieties possess the ability to code-switch. These “codes” may encompass different registers, ranging from formal to informal. For example, consider a scenario where you’re conversing casually with a friend, but upon encountering your lecturer, both you and your friend seamlessly transition to a more formal register of speech. Similarly, for speakers of multiple language varieties, such as standard and non-standard forms, code-switching offers a flexible means of linguistic expression. Exploring the multifaceted phenomenon of code-switching, we delve into its intricacies beyond mere linguistic dynamics. While linguistic factors do influence code-switching, situational, contextual, and even sociocultural elements intricately shape this phenomenon. Individuals often navigate through a linguistic repertoire shaped by diverse contexts, adapting their language use to suit varying social environments. In addition to linguistic factors, situational variables play a pivotal role in code-switching. Consider the scenario where individuals seamlessly transition between languages or language varieties based on the context, such as switching from formal to informal language registers depending on the social setting. Moreover, the mode of communication, whether it’s written or spoken, digital or face-to-face, further influences the patterns of code-switching observed. Furthermore, paralinguistic features such as gestures, intonations, and facial expressions contribute significantly to the nuanced nature of code-switching. These non-verbal cues often complement linguistic shifts, enhancing communicative efficacy and adding layers of meaning to interactions. The interplay between verbal and non-verbal elements enriches the communicative experience, offering insights into cultural nuances and interpersonal dynamics. Indeed, code-switching is a multifaceted phenomenon deeply intertwined with sociocultural contexts. It reflects not only linguistic diversity but also the intricate interplay between language, identity, and social interaction. By examining code-switching through a holistic lens, we gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of communication in diverse linguistic landscapes. Over the years, our understanding of code switching has evolved significantly, challenging previous misconceptions and recognizing it as a natural and intricate aspect of bilingual communication. Historically, parents were often advised to prioritize the dominant language of the society over minority or heritage languages, fearing that exposing children to multiple languages simultaneously would hinder their linguistic development. This advice stemmed from concerns about potential confusion and the belief that proficiency in one language could be compromised if multiple languages were introduced early on. However, extensive research spanning more than five decades has reshaped our perspective on code switching. It is now viewed as a normative linguistic phenomenon and a manifestation of the bilingual speaker’s rich expressive repertoire. Rather than being a hindrance, code switching is understood as a natural realization of cultural and linguistic identity, reflecting the speaker’s affiliation with multiple cultures. In contemporary discourse, code switching is embraced as an inherent feature of bilingual speech. While individual preferences and abilities vary, code switching often occurs organically when speakers interact with interlocutors proficient in both languages. It serves as a means of establishing rapport and navigating social dynamics, allowing speakers to seamlessly transition between linguistic codes based on the communicative context. Now, let’s explore the different types of code switching, which offer insights into its varied functions and manifestations. The first type, situational or domain-based code switching, occurs when distinct social settings or domains prompt the use of different languages. For instance, individuals may use one language at home (often a minority or heritage language) and another language in public settings (typically the dominant society language). This type of code switching reflects the social functions assigned to each language within specific contexts. The second type, addressee-based code switching, revolves around the conversational partners involved. Speakers may switch between languages to accommodate the linguistic preferences or proficiency levels of their interlocutors. This form of code switching can serve to include or exclude individuals from the conversation, depending on their familiarity with the language being used. Understanding code switching as a dynamic and contextually driven phenomenon is crucial for various reasons. Firstly, it sheds light on the complex interplay between language, culture, and identity in bilingual individuals. Secondly, it provides valuable insights into social dynamics and communication strategies within multilingual communities. Lastly, awareness of code switching enhances our appreciation for linguistic diversity and fosters inclusive communication practices in diverse settings. The examples you’ve provided offer valuable insights into the diverse functions and manifestations of code switching. Let’s delve deeper into the discussion and explore additional aspects of this fascinating linguistic phenomenon. Another common type of code switching occurs when individuals switch from one language to another to reach a broader audience or provide access to their content. For instance, musicians may transition from English to their heritage or minority language in their songs, thereby appealing to a more diverse global audience and celebrating their cultural identity through language. Furthermore, there’s a type of code switching known as metaphorical code switching, where language choice is used to define or frame the situation rather than being dictated by it. In this context, speakers make deliberate and noticeable language choices that emphasize their group identity or convey a specific message. A notable example is New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s use of Te Reo Māori alongside English in her UN addresses, highlighting her cultural heritage and national identity. It’s crucial to recognize that bilingualism and multilingualism are not exceptions but rather the norm, outnumbering monolingual speakers globally. Therefore, promoting the use of heritage and minority languages is vital for fostering linguistic diversity and inclusivity. By normalizing bilingualism and code switching in public domains, we embrace linguistic expression as a natural and enriching aspect of human communication. In recent years, bilingualism as a research area has garnered significant attention, offering insights into various perspectives, including cognitive benefits, bilingual education, and policymaking. However, today, our focus remains on language use, particularly on the behavior typical of bilingual individuals—code switching. In essence, code switching involves the fluid mixing of two or more languages within discourse, extending beyond single sentences. Individuals proficient in multiple languages have the ability to seamlessly transition between different linguistic codes, which may encompass various registers, from formal to informal. For example, in a casual conversation with friends, one might switch to a more informal register, whereas in the presence of a lecturer, a more formal register may be employed. The example you’ve provided illustrates how code switching operates within linguistic contexts, showcasing its versatility and adaptability to different situations. Let’s delve deeper into the nuances of code switching and explore its various manifestations. In multilingual environments, speakers often navigate between different language varieties, including both standard and non-standard forms. Depending on the communicative context, individuals have the flexibility to select the most appropriate language variety for the situation. For instance, in formal settings such as academic or professional environments, speakers may opt for a standard language variety, whereas in informal or familiar settings, they may switch to a non-standard or vernacular variety. Moreover, code switching is not solely confined to language choice but extends to various modes of communication. Consider the difference in linguistic behaviors between written communication, such as emails or text messages, and face-to-face conversations. Each mode of communication elicits distinct linguistic features and norms, influencing the way individuals express themselves. Additionally, paralinguistic features, such as gestures and facial expressions, play a significant role in code switching. These nonverbal cues often complement verbal communication and can vary depending on the situational context and the speaker’s mood or emotional state. Therefore, individuals may employ paralinguistic features differently based on the specific circumstances they find themselves in. As a dynamic process, code switching is highly sensitive to the nuances of contextual use, including factors such as the setting, the audience (or interlocutor), and the speaker’s intentions and preferences. The choice of code—whether it involves switching between language varieties, registers, modes of communication, or paralinguistic features—reflects the complex interplay between linguistic competence and situational demands. Now, let’s analyze the example from Comedy Central to identify the types of code switching patterns exhibited by the speakers. Despite both speakers using English, they demonstrate a clear shift between language varieties—Standard English and non-standard African American vernacular. This exemplifies how code switching transcends mere language choice and encompasses broader linguistic dimensions, enriching communication and reflecting diverse cultural and social identities. Understanding the evolution of our perception of code switching provides valuable insight into its significance and impact on language use. Initially, code switching was viewed as a speech deficiency, characterized by the inability to adhere to a single language consistently—a deviation from the perceived linguistic norm. Consequently, it was often stigmatized as undesirable behavior, leading to misguided advice for parents to prioritize the dominant societal language over minority or heritage languages for their children’s linguistic development. However, over the past five decades, extensive research has reshaped our understanding of code switching, recognizing it as a normal linguistic process. Rather than a deficiency, code switching is now seen as an indication of a broader expressive repertoire and a natural realization of bilingual or multilingual identity. Bilingual individuals seamlessly navigate between languages, reflecting their cultural heritage and linguistic versatility. This paradigm shift acknowledges code switching as an integral aspect of bilingual speech, occurring naturally in communicative contexts where interlocutors share proficiency in multiple languages. As we delve into the types of code switching, it becomes apparent that its manifestations are multifaceted. Situational or domain-based code switching revolves around the social functions of languages, where distinct languages are used in different settings. For example, individuals may use one language at home (typically a minority or heritage language) and another outside the home (usually the dominant societal language). This pattern reflects the sociolinguistic dynamics of bilingual communities, highlighting the coexistence of multiple linguistic identities. In contrast, addressee-based code switching is influenced by conversational partners, allowing speakers to include or exclude them by selecting a language familiar or unfamiliar to the addressee. For instance, musicians may switch between languages in their songs to cater to diverse audiences or convey specific messages effectively. Understanding code switching as a dynamic and context-dependent phenomenon is crucial for various reasons. Firstly, it fosters linguistic inclusivity and validates the linguistic diversity of bilingual and multilingual individuals. Moreover, it enriches our appreciation of cultural identity and heritage, acknowledging the fluidity of language use in multicultural societies. Additionally, recognizing and embracing code switching enhances communication strategies and facilitates effective intercultural interactions, promoting mutual understanding and respect across linguistic boundaries. In conclusion, code switching transcends mere linguistic behavior; it embodies the intricate interplay between language, culture, and identity. Embracing code switching as a natural and enriching aspect of bilingualism empowers individuals to navigate diverse linguistic landscapes confidently, fostering a more inclusive and harmonious society. In exploring code switching, we encounter a fascinating phenomenon where individuals seamlessly transition between languages or language varieties within a single conversation or discourse. One intriguing aspect is when individuals switch from a dominant language like English to their heritage or minority language, thereby inclusively engaging a wider global audience and granting them access to cultural expressions, such as songs. This form of code switching not only reflects linguistic versatility but also fosters cultural exchange and appreciation. Another intriguing type of code switching is metaphorical, where language serves to define the situation rather than being dictated by it. In metaphorical code switching, speakers make deliberate and noticeable choices that underscore group identity or emphasize specific cultural contexts. A notable example is the UN address by Jacinda Ardern, where she intersperses her speech with Teto Maori alongside English, symbolizing her identity as a New Zealander and highlighting the significance of linguistic diversity. Understanding code switching becomes paramount when considering the prevalence of bilingualism and multilingualism, which outnumber monolingualism globally. With bilingualism being the norm, it is imperative to appreciate how multiple languages are utilized at societal and individual levels. Promoting the use of heritage and minority languages is essential for linguistic diversity and cultural preservation, emphasizing the need to normalize bilingualism and code switching in public discourse. Transitioning to stylistic analysis of texts, traditionally confined to literary works, has evolved to encompass a broader spectrum of texts, including film scripts, song lyrics, and digital communication. Stylistics delves into the linguistic devices that shape expressive or literary styles, shedding light on language evolution and development across various mediums. As we delve into stylistic analysis, we can explore its implications for language development, change, and translation. For instance, examining characterization in literary works like Harry Potter unveils the intricate use of stylistic devices, such as alliteration in character names like Severus Snape, which pose challenges for translators in capturing the nuances of language and maintaining fidelity to the original text. In essence, code switching and stylistic analysis offer profound insights into the dynamic nature of language, its role in cultural expression, and the complexities of communication across diverse linguistic landscapes. Embracing linguistic diversity and understanding the intricacies of language use enriches our appreciation of human expression and fosters interconnectedness in an increasingly globalized world. In dissecting the intricacies of character portrayal through stylistic devices, Severus Snape emerges as a prime example of how language choices shape characterization in literary works. J.K. Rowling masterfully employs alliteration and snake imagery in Snape’s name to underscore his association with Slytherin, the house symbolized by a snake. This dense utilization of stylistic devices poses a significant challenge for translators tasked with capturing the essence of the original text in their respective languages. Examining translations of Snape’s character name across different languages unveils fascinating adaptations. For instance, in Italian, Snape becomes Severus Piton, sacrificing alliteration but retaining the snake imagery as “pitone” translates to python. Similarly, in French, Snape is rendered as Severus Rogue, where alliteration is forsaken, yet characterization as an arrogant figure remains intact. Conversely, in Russian, Snape is named Severus Sneeg, preserving alliteration but losing the snake association as “sneeg” lacks any serpentine connotations. Another character of interest is Hagrid, whose distinctive West Country accent serves as a defining trait in the original text. J.K. Rowling imbues Hagrid’s speech with colloquialisms and regional dialect, reflecting his humble background and incomplete wizarding education. Translating Hagrid’s unique manner of speaking poses a notable challenge, with various approaches adopted by translators worldwide. In many translations, attempts are made to convey Hagrid’s informal speech patterns through the use of informal collocations, albeit with varying degrees of success. However, some translations opt to omit distinctions in accent entirely, potentially diluting the character’s authenticity. Yet, one particularly intriguing adaptation arises in Japanese translations, where Hagrid speaks in the Tohoku dialect, a rural Japanese dialect. This choice adds a layer of authenticity to Hagrid’s portrayal, aligning with his rustic origins and lending cultural depth to the narrative. The diverse approaches taken by translators in capturing the essence of characters like Snape and Hagrid underscore the complexities of linguistic and cultural adaptation in literary translation. It highlights the delicate balance between fidelity to the original text and the need to resonate with target audiences in different linguistic and cultural contexts. Ultimately, these adaptations enrich the global tapestry of literature, offering readers insights into the richness of linguistic diversity and cultural nuances across the world. The significance of stylistic devices, whether in linguistic names or pronunciation, becomes evident in the challenges they pose for translators. The translator’s task extends beyond mere translation; it encompasses the faithful interpretation of the message while preserving its tone and context. This balancing act underscores the complexity inherent in linguistic adaptation across languages. Shifting our focus to another example of stylistic analysis, we delve into the realm of internet language, characterized by its creative adaptation to the constraints of written communication. Emojis, initially conceived as nonverbal gestures, have evolved to serve multifaceted functions. For instance, the clap emoji not only punctuates expressions but also adds emphasis, often accompanying tweets with activist themes. Moreover, typographic elements such as capitalization and letter repetition are harnessed to convey emotional depth, as seen in the phenomenon known as cry typing. Cry typing, marked by frequent typographical errors, signifies emotional distress or serves as a performative expression thereof. Conversely, minimal punctuation and the absence of capitalization evoke a flat, sarcastic tone, signaling deliberate linguistic choices rather than oversight. Understanding the intricacies of internet language requires a nuanced approach. In her book, Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language, linguist Gretchen McCulloch explores these nuances, offering insights into the evolving landscape of online communication. Importantly, the language used on the internet does not indicate a decline in linguistic standards; rather, it reflects deliberate choices made by users, who navigate linguistic conventions with awareness and adaptability. In essence, the exploration of stylistic analysis in both literary texts and internet discourse underscores the dynamic nature of language and its adaptability across different contexts. By recognizing and understanding these nuances, we gain deeper insights into the rich tapestry of human communication and the evolving nature of linguistic expression in the digital age. Furthermore, it’s essential to recognize that linguistic codes vary across different contexts. For instance, cry typing—a phenomenon prevalent in internet communication—is unlikely to manifest in formal academic essays submitted to universities. This underscores the contextual specificity of language use and the importance of adapting communication styles to suit diverse settings. Combining parts four and five of this lecture on discourse analysis and corpus linguistics allows for a comprehensive exploration of these interconnected fields. To delve deeper into these topics, students are encouraged to explore the expertise of scholars at the School of Languages and Cultures in the UK, such as Ilana, Rod, Michael, and Valeria. Their research profiles and publications offer valuable insights into the frameworks of discourse analysis, particularly conversation analysis, providing a rich foundation for further inquiry. In conclusion, today’s lecture has illuminated the multifaceted nature of language in discourse research. By examining language in context, researchers uncover how it functions and adapts in response to various external factors, including social backgrounds and cultural influences. One notable advantage of discourse analysis is the abundance of readily available data for analysis, coupled with the ease of creating customized datasets. However, it’s imperative to prioritize ethical considerations when collecting or utilizing data, obtaining proper clearance and adhering to established transcription conventions. Through meticulous analysis and ethical practice, researchers can unlock a deeper understanding of language in discourse, paving the way for innovative insights and discoveries in linguistic research.
