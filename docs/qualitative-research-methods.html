<p>-Hello and thank you for tuning in to another lecture on research methods. Today we are going to talk about qualitative research. Before we begin, let’s start by just reminding ourselves what we have done. Last week, we have looked at choosing and devising an appropriate methodology for our study.</p>
<p>-Specifically, we had talked about participant recruitment; we also discussed materials that we could use for our studies such as word lists, a set of pictures, and things like that. And also, the tasks that we’re setting up for participants, the procedures, which would tie up our participants with our materials, and instruct them on how to engage with the materials.</p>
<p>-So today, and in the next week, we’re going to continue looking at the research methodology. But we’re also broadening our scope. Back to discussing what a research question is, we’re also going to look at the types of data that we can collect in linguistic and applied linguistic research, how we interpret the data, and how we write it up in a final report. And all of those questions are going to be addressed in light of comparing qualitative and quantitative studies.</p>
<p>-So the focus of today’s lecture is qualitative research. And we’re going to begin by providing a definition and discussing some features of qualitative research. Then we’re going to go through the core study types in qualitative research. I’m going to focus in particular on case study and on an ethnography. But we’re also going to very briefly go through some other study types as well. Then we’ll proceed to discussing qualitative data collection procedures, such as observation, interview and questionnaire which we have already talked about focus group diary and discourse analysis. And then we will conclude by discussing the strengths and the weaknesses of qualitative research. Okay, let’s begin.</p>
<p>-Okay, so let us begin with an overview of qualitative research. And we’re going to start this overview by discussing its definition. You already know that qualitative research is an entire research family along with quantitative research, which means that it comprises a lot of different research techniques.</p>
<p>-The way we define qualitative research is we say that it’s the type of research that focuses on meaning making. So it aims at answering this very big general questions about the world around us, such as what is going on? why is a certain phenomenon occurring? And how do we understand this phenomenon? Or what is the process that is behind this phenomenon? So all of these questions are aimed at making sense of the world around us.</p>
<p>-It’s also the research that presents the collected data in words and not numbers. So if you ever read a qualitative research study, you will see that the discussion of the results is going to contain different codes, labels, narratives, and vignettes, rather than statistical significance or the results of statistical tests. So you will not typically find numerical data in qualitative research ups. And then finally, we’ll also look at qualitative research as the type of research that analyzes the data by interpretive means which, once again, is very closely connected with the meaning making aspect of qualitative research.</p>
<p>-And it stands for the researcher trying to shed light on a particular issue or a particular problem by interpreting collected data. Qualitative research is employed in many different academic disciplines. Traditionally, it has been associated with the social sciences, such as anthropology and philosophy. But more recently, it has been introduced in more disciplines and applied fields as well, for instance psychology, education, linguistics and applied linguistics, policy analysis, Business Studies, law, medical and environmental research.</p>
<p>-The assumptions that qualitative research makes about our world is that reality is multifaceted, complex, socially constructed, which means that it’s inherently subjective, and can only be researched holistically. And that last point leads us to thinking that the variables or phenomena under investigation are assumed to be very complex and interconnected, which makes them difficult to be measured and isolated for a study.</p>
<p>-So let’s say we would like to investigate maintenance of heritage languages in multilingual communities, which would be a lot of different immigrant communities in Australia, where English would be the dominant language of the wider society. And then those communities would also speak another or more than one heritage languages at home. And so we’re interested that what do they do to preserve those languages in their family and community.</p>
<p>-And if we’re interested in a question like that, we may need to look at a lot of different factors, such as, for instance, perceived linguistic prestige of the heritage language, versus the dominant society language. And a lot of different languages hold different perceived linguistic prestige. So for example, some of the European languages are perceived to have a very high prestige. And so maybe it’s easier to maintain them than the languages that have lower social prestige.</p>
<p>-We can also look at language policies in Australia, educational policies that are adopted in the schools within the communities reach also at availability of different services and media in the heritage language, because that would make that heritage language more accessible, and would encourage the speakers of a heritage language to actually maintain their proficiency.</p>
<p>-We can also look at socio linguistic and socio cultural affiliation of individuals. So is that their preference to conform to the wider society? Or would they like to really strongly maintain their cultural identity? To explore these questions, we can examine the code switching patterns of those individuals. So to say whether English creeps into that utterance or utterances in their heritage language, we can also look at the generational factors at the identity issues within a particular individual and many, many other factors.</p>
<p>-So according to qualitative research, those factors are not really existing independently of one another. And it’s really hard to single one out without having some influence of the other factors on the target question. The nature of qualitative research is exploratory. So the aim is to often discover new ideas and gain new insights into a phenomenon that the researcher observes in their day to day life.</p>
<p>-So here is a research question one may propose, how do immigrant communities in Australia maintain their heritage language? You would notice that this question has still room to grow and emerge, and the researcher may not start with a specific research question even though we have discussed that starting with a very particular question is a good practice because it helps guide your research.</p>
<p>-In qualitative research, it is quite common to start with a research purpose rather than a research question, or a broader area of interest, which is sometimes referred to as research inquiry. As the research question is emerging, we could also describe qualitative research as being nonlinear because the research question can be reworked and refined as the project is being undertaken and new insights are being gained in many different ways.</p>
<p>-So for instance, the example above may be changed to focus on generational differences in heritage language maintenance. So whether the second generation or the third generation immigrants have different attitudes to heritage language maintenance, we can also focus on differences according to the cultural group. So what kind of heritage language and heritage culture are we examining?</p>
<p>-Or for example, if looking at the influence on Social media on language maintenance, there could be a lot of other possibilities that the researcher decides to take. So that’s what is meant by nonlinear. The possibilities of adjusting and reworking an initial research question are endless, and they’re very much dependent on the context in which the study is occurring.</p>
<p>-Qualitative research is also described as being inductive, which means that we start with an individual observation or maybe a group of observations. And they’re very idiosyncratic, so specific to the context and the setting in which they occur. Then from that observation, we hopefully work out a pattern of certain behavior.</p>
<p>-If we’re focusing on studies in linguistics and applied linguistics, based on the patterns that we observe, we can propose a working hypothesis, which is a bit broader and a bit more generalized than the specific pattern. And then we can go ahead and test that hypothesis to propose a theory that would be applicable to a wide population.</p>
<p>-In saying that however, it is important to understand qualitative research does not aim to be predictive or generalizable. So while some studies may end up proposing a theory based on their initial observations, patterns, and then hypothesis testing, it is not the target of qualitative research, because the target is to explore one particular scenario in great depth.
-And it is important to understand that this scenario may differ from the next in many different ways. And this may not be generalizable to either another case or to wider population.</p>
<p>-Okay, now, we’re moving on to features of qualitative research. So here we could say that qualitative research focuses on participants interaction with experiences with a view on certain phenomena. So here we highlight once again, the subjectivity of qualitative research, those interactions, experiences and views are ideally explored in the natural setting.</p>
<p>-So in their community, in the language classroom, at home, in the workplace, online, in natural conversation. And the researcher exercises no or very minimal intervention on the research process. So the setting is not controlled, created, or set up, the researcher aims to observe the participants were examined the participants behavior in as natural setting as responsible.</p>
<p>-So to highlight those features, I have found a couple of quotes that I would like to share with you. The first one is that qualitative researchers go to the people, they do not extricate people from their everyday worlds. In examining this quote, I would like for you to think whether this aligns more with this definition of fieldwork or desk work that we have covered last week.</p>
<p>-So that’s something we will come back to in our tutorial. And then the second quote is by William Labov, who is considered to be the founding father of modern day sociolinguistics, the study of language in society. And so he says that the aim of linguistic research in the community must be to find out how people talk when they’re not being systematically observed.</p>
<p>-Yet we can only obtain this data by systematic observation. So he highlights what is known as the observer paradox, or sometimes the observer effect. And what I would like for you to reflect on is how can we overcome this observer paradox? So how can we achieve gaining those natural behaviors from people when they know that they’ve been studied with a being observed? Once again, this question is something that we’re going to come back in our tutorial.</p>
<p>-Okay, so to wrap up the features of the qualitative research, it is also important to highlight that the purpose of qualitative approach to research is to interpret, contextualize and understand a variety of participants perspective on the phenomenon under investigation. Once again, you will note here that we’re not aiming to summarize those perspectives.</p>
<p>-We’re treating them as individual points of view and we’re aiming to gain an in depth comprehension of each of those
perspectives. Data in qualitative research is analyzed by themes and categorization. And research reports include many quotes from participants to illustrate the points and the arguments that the researcher is trying to make. And as a result, the write up of a research paper or a research thesis in qualitative research will be largely of a descriptive nature.</p>
<p>-So now that we’re familiar with the nature and the core features of qualitative research, let’s look at some of the qualitative study types. And we’re going to start with examining case studies. So, in case studies, the scope of investigation is determined by the researcher’s interest. In many sources, you will see that case studies are referred to as being bounded systems, which means that the scope and the interest of the researcher is the determining factor of what is being investigated. In a case study, three different types of case studies are identified depending on how narrow or how wide that interest or that scope is.</p>
<p>-So the first type is an intrinsic case study, which means that we’re focusing on describing an individual case of a particular person. And here Our aim is just to provide a very detailed and in depth description of their behavior, their experiences or their opinions on a particular phenomenon. If we stick with our example of the heritage language maintenance, we can pose a question like how is this individual maintaining their heritage language? In this case, we’re not interested in any way of extrapolating or comparing our findings to other external cases, our goal is solely in describing this particular individual.</p>
<p>-The second type is an instrumental case study. So here, we once again are very narrowly focused on exploring a particular issue. However, unlike the intrinsic case, studies of instrumental case studies presuppose some interpretation in addition to the description. So here, we can ask a question like, how can heritage language maintenance be better supported based on the account provided by an individual under investigation.</p>
<p>-So here, we start out with describing an individual case, their experiences and their opinions, but then we take it a step further, and based on this account, we provide some suggestions, or we explore the issue that has been raised by an individual.</p>
<p>-And then finally, we can identify collective or multiple case studies. So here we focus on both describing and evaluating but this time, we’ll look at multiple cases in light of a particular issue. So the question we can ask here could be why some individuals are more successful at maintaining their heritage language than others, and what can be done to better support heritage language maintenance.</p>
<p>-Here, we explore a group dynamic in relation to a particular issue. Usually that group is also not too big. And the individuals that participate in a case study are somehow interconnected. So they can maybe belong to the same location go to the same school, or have a pre-existing relationship before they begin a case study.</p>
<p>-So when we define a case study, we need to understand what we mean by the word case. And this is explained differently depending on the area of your research interest. So for example, in the studies of second language acquisition, linguistics, applied linguistics, or socio linguistics psycholinguistics. a case study is usually focusing on a single individual, or sometimes on a small group.</p>
<p>-In second language acquisition, we can sometimes also look at an institution. So for instance, a classroom, a department or faculty at a university, a university, but in other studies, for example, in Political Studies, a case may represent a large entity such as a state or country.</p>
<p>-Now ethnographic studies are another big group of qualitative research studies in Applied Linguistics and Linguistics. And their aim is to describe people’s behavior in naturally occurring ongoing settings through prolonged observation. So through this definition, I’m hoping that you’re able to identify that ethnographic studies by nature are longitudinal and that observed behavior needs to be interpreted through a cultural lens.</p>
<p>-So this is one of the key features that distinguishes an ethnography from a case study. While a case study may also look at people’s behavior in natural occurring, ongoing settings, it doesn’t always have to connect it back to the cultural background of that group, while an ethnography study at its core looks at the people’s culture.</p>
<p>-Now, because culture is not specific to an individual, but rather unites a group of people, the focus of an ethnography is also on the group rather than individuals and the processes that occur in that group. So what we mean by those processes are some traditions and customs expected behavior of the group. So what they do, their linguistic behavior, what they say, group membership, and gatekeeping. How is this group able to identify who is an insider and an outsider to the group, and what kind of measures they’re taking to maintain this distinction between the insiders and the outsiders?</p>
<p>-Ethnographic research actually began as the study of less known cultures. But as the researchers have realized that a cultural lens can be applied to the communities that they’re a part of, ethnography actually lost its focus on the other. And now a wide variety of communities is studied through the ethnographic and cultural lens. Groups either share the same location, which has been that traditional ethnographic approach, or a particular feature. So for instance, a group that could be a subject to an ethnographic study could work in the same industry, communicate on the same website, or even belong to the same generation. So for instance, we can talk about millennial culture, but those groups do not necessarily have to live in the same location.</p>
<p>-Results of an ethnographic study is a comprehensive cultural portrait of a group and their linguistic behavior if we’re talking about linguistic and applied linguistic research. So once again, here we may want to look at things like cultural influences on heritage language maintenance in Lebanese Arabic immigrant communities in Australia.</p>
<p>-Once again, here, I would like to highlight that the cultural angle is what separates an ethnography from a case study. Okay, so the case study and ethnography are the two core study techniques or study methodologies that are often employed in qualitative research.</p>
<p>-But qualitative research is by no means restrained to those two methodologies. And here, on slide 14, I’m just going to very briefly introduce some other qualitative study types. So, the first one is action research. And this is something that we have been discussing before briefly, but we will come back to in a separate lecture.</p>
<p>-So action research is a self reflective process and approach to researching one’s own professional practices with practical outcomes to improve one’s professional goals or one’s professional careers and outcomes. So action research is applicable in many different fields, such as learning and teaching a second language interpreting and translation, and even the research practices can be improved through action research.</p>
<p>-Narrative inquiry is an analysis of a person’s life through collection of stories about their experiences, narrative inquiry, have been widely implemented in second language studies as a person’s life, say, if it’s an immigrant, is closely interconnected with their progress in acquisition of their target language. So sometimes, a story of their life is very reflective of the story of their progress as a learner of a second language.</p>
<p>-And then one last type of a study that I would like to introduce today is phenomenology. So phenomenology is a study that collects subjective experiences, opinions and meanings from several individuals in relation to a single phenomenon. And so through this diversity of opinions, you are trying to paint a more comprehensive worldview in relation to a particular issue or a particular problem.</p>
<p>-Let’s now turn to qualitative data collection procedures. So the tasks that the participants may be presented with if they decide to contribute to qualitative research. One of the common causes of data collection procedures is an observation, which means that we notice and record natural behaviors of our participants as they go about their daily lives. So observations fall into a number of different categories, we can distinguish between structured versus casual or unstructured observations.</p>
<p>-So when a researcher undertakes a structured observation, it means that they have a checklist of certain behaviors that they need to pay attention to, which means data coding and processing are a much more streamlined process. However, it means that some other behaviors that may also be interesting, go unnoticed.</p>
<p>-In casual observation, a researcher does not have a checklist of things to look out for. And so therefore, the task is to just notice and observe any patterns that seem of relevance and of interest to a research question if it’s there, or to a broader research inquiry. In this case, data processing can be fairly time consuming just because of the richness of the data.</p>
<p>-But some more interesting patterns may emerge and may serve as the basis for narrowing down the research question. Observational research also varies based on the role that the research takes, we can distinguish between the complete observer and a participant observer.</p>
<p>-So a complete observer is a researcher that is unknown to the participant group that’s under observation that ensures the most natural behavior from the participants. However, it also raises ethical questions. Obviously, nobody would like to be observed without knowing that they’re actually under observation.</p>
<p>-Participant observer means that the researcher is a part of the community that is being observed and they participate in their daily lives. So this is more ethically sound. However, this raises the question of observer objectivity versus subjectivity, because if they’re involved in the process under study, are they able to interpret it from a distance.</p>
<p>-Another very common qualitative data collection procedure is an interview and that’s something that we have discussed in the last week’s tutorial. So interviews once again can fall into several categories based on how structured they are. And for qualitative data collection. We usually go with unstructured or semi structured interviews, unstructured interviews, pretty much advocate for the researcher, listening to the participant semi structured interviews, guide the interview process with a bit more precision.</p>
<p>-Asking question is also very useful techniques in qualitative research, particularly if we look at open ended questions. So here I would like to make a quick note that we have talked about observations, interviews, and question is in last week’s tutorial, however, in this week’s tutorial, we’re going to continue talking about those three procedures. And we’re going to do a quick observation practice. And we’re going to go through the do’s and the don’ts of interview and questionnaire question design.</p>
<p>-A focus group is somewhere in between the interview and the questionnaire. So you can think of focus group as multiple interviews with people from diverse backgrounds, discussing the same topic or voicing their opinions on the same issue. So here you get the benefit of the multiple interviews, but also the group dynamic.</p>
<p>-So it may be a bit more efficient to conduct a focus group than individual interviews in terms of time efficiency. Focus groups are also perceived to be bit less confronting than an individual interview, much like questionnaire is because a participant in the focus group does not necessarily express their opinions directly to the researcher.</p>
<p>-A diary is a methods of data collection that reflects first person opinions and introspective journals of a participant. So here you get quite a large amount of data and rich data. But diaries also raise a question of participants subjectivity because diaries just by definition, represent somebody’s subjective opinion.</p>
<p>-And then finally, discourse analysis is also a procedure that is very widely employed in qualitative research. And that’s basically an examination of language use in both speech and writing. And that’s also a topic that we will come back to in a separate week. So obviously, before starting a research project, researchers need to make an informed decision on whether qualitative research is right for their research purposes, it is important that they’re aware of research strength and weaknesses of this particular approach,</p>
<p>-So we’re going to start by examining the strength of qualitative research. And one of the key advantages of this approach is that it provides an in depth and rich description of a phenomenon, which is much more in line with how we see and understand the reality around us in all of its complexity and interconnection between the different factors.</p>
<p>-In addition to that, qualitative research may serve as a very important step from an inception of an idea to a more general and comprehensive conceptual frameworks. In one of the first weeks we have discussed that some of the Exploratory Studies may not aim to provide or propose specific hypothesis or test specific theories. But those Exploratory Studies are necessary to be able to devise those more specific research questions and predictions in future research.</p>
<p>-And then finally, qualitative research allows for a very vivid and meaningful look into an issue with concrete examples, which may be more accessible, and convincing to the reader or the audience to which the research is presented. And if we perceive this reader or the audience to be a policymaker in say, bilingual education, or a practitioner, a second language teacher and interpreter or translator it may seem that those vivid examples are preferable as they may be less dry or difficult to interpret and detached from an individual than numeric accounts of data.</p>
<p>-Now, as for the weaknesses of qualitative research, we need to start by acknowledging the data collection and processing in qualitative studies are extremely labor and time intensive. Not only have we highlighted that some of the procedures involve prolonged observations, but the data coding and data processing itself may require a lot of different steps that also consume a lot of researchers time.</p>
<p>-So for instance, after conducting an interview, you also need to transcribe the recorded interview data, to be able to find patterns and code certain utterances produced by the participant. There is also a certain level of subjectivity in qualitative research, and that may come from a couple of different sources. Firstly, learners the researcher bias especially prevalent if the researcher is not just a passive observer in the situation under investigation.</p>
<p>-However, this can be combated if the researcher employs the method of triangulation, which means that they could use more than one scientific method to collect data, which would serve as a guard against this bias. And then there is a participant bias as well, which stems from obtaining an emic or an insider point of view.</p>
<p>-So for instance, if we conduct an interview or if we ask our participants to submit a diary, by definition, the data that we’re getting is going to be representative of their subjective point of view on the world. generalizability of findings is also an issue that is attributed to qualitative research due to the idiosyncratic nature of the investigation. So, as we have mentioned before, one case may not necessarily relate well or be informative of another case.</p>
<p>-And then finally, credibility and quality of conclusions in qualitative research may be questioned by some, as then it is subject to interpretation by the researcher, and interpretations may vary according to the theoretical concepts that this particular researcher subscribes to, but also according to their personal experiences.</p>
<p>-To combat those weaknesses, research encourages to employ both qualitative and quantitative techniques and thus conduct mixed studies to obtain both subjective and an objective look at a certain problem. So let me conclude this lecture by highlighting a few key points that I would like for you to remember.</p>
<p>-So first of all, let’s start with definition of qualitative research. Qualitative research aims to capture and interpret the complexity of the real world through individual or group perspective and describe it through words rather than numbers. So qualitative research does not shy away from the diversity or the complexity of multitude of opinions and description of the account of this diversity is presented through theme analysis, interpretation and categorization, which is usually supplied demanded by real vivid examples and quotes obtained from the participants.</p>
<p>-Qualitative research obtains data that is extremely rich in detail, which is both a strength of this approach and a weakness. It is a strength because it gives us a comprehensive account of the collected data and the participants behavior or their opinions, but it is a weakness because such rich data doesn’t allow for quick processing or analysis. Because these findings are extremely contextualized which means that their specific their particular setting, they may not be informative of or comparable to other cases or representative of wider population, which is one of the main criticisms that qualitative research receives.</p>
